        "description": "Our Mr. Al's HungryHelper app is a random restaurant generator. The user logs into their account. They fill out a form with price, location, and type of food as required criteria. When they hit submit, a Yelp API sends data to an array matching the criteria they requested. Then we use a random number generator to grab a random restaurant in the array to show to the user. The user can then hit make reservation which prompts them to fill out a form in order to make a reservation to the restaurant. The information entered will be uploaded to MongoDB and displayed on the reservations page. The user can also update and delete the reservation.",
